# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II/Final Design Decisions

Since the completion of Part II, I have made many changes, most of them being design focused. One change was in response to the comments I received during my interviews related to design choices and how the inconsistent use of colors were distracting. My interviewees also mentioned that that they would have liked more clear headers to separate each section of my project (like "chapters" in a book as someone had mentioned) because the inconsistent text sizes made it difficult to clearly navigate the storyline for the viewer and unclear what the main idea of each section was. The color scheme was a bit unorganized in my Part II because I wanted to use all three colors of the American Flag due to this but it seemed like there was no rhyme or reason to the organization. I realized, after my interviews, that while the color choices themselves can make sense in the context (American flag colors for U.S. student loan debt and audiences: policymakers and U.S. higher education institutions), if they are used sporatically (as I did for Part II), it can hinder the message of my story. Therefore, to address these comments, I decided to use of colors more logically and sparingly. For example, I decided to remove the use of red for text because I realized it created too much eye travel with the red text and was often a harder color to read against white background. Therefore, I decided to mainly use blue text, with some white text, and used the red as more of an accent color used sparingly. I also decided to create clearer distinctions between headers of each section by bolding them and/orseparating them on their own page in shorthand and the use of hierarchy of text. I think this was an improvement from Part II because it allows clearer portrayal of information without creating unncessary eye travel. I also played around with the background colors because some of the text was hard to read against the background images or darker color backgrounds and I think this also improved readibility. I learned that even if I want to use many different colors, simplicity is often better. I decided to use green for the colors of the data visualizations because I thought it would be an appropriate color for the subject matter and follows conventions that green is linked to U.S. currency. For the mental health visualization, I decided to use blue because I felt that the green was too apathetic and blue is often associated with mental health and calmness, even if the data isn't necessarily positive, the blue felt like an appropriate color to represent the data. For the data visualizations related to showing disparities between genders, after consideration of whether to use green to follow the rest of the data visualizations, it felt more appropriate to use the conventional colors of blue and pink. Also, I decided to add more connection to the students and to also break up some of the text, I added more images of students. Finally, another design change I made was related to contrast between text and background. In Part II, a lot of my text was hard to read against the background, especially opaque backgrounds, so I made changes to ensure enough contrast for readibility across the design. 

Another change I made in response to the comments I received during my interviews was clarifying and narrowing down my audience. For Part 1, I had 4 audiences: students, higher education insitutions, policymakers, and employers. I realized, after my interviews, that with the story I was telling about the lasting negative effects of student loan debt, while student loan debt involves students, the message of my story didn't really align nor was truly meant for students. I also didn't feel like employers were the main target audience, even though they too can play a part in helping to solve the student loan debt crisis. Therefore, I decided to narrow my audience to higher education institutions and policymakers. At first, I wanted to narrow down my audience only to higher educaiton institutions, but after much consideration, I realized that higher education institutions and policymakers can be related in many aspects in this regard and because the message of my story is the negative long term effects of student loan debt, it seem appropriate that the audiences be those who can create the impactful and widespread change through policies and the schools themselves. From this, I learned that trying to communicate to too many different audiences can make it harder to tailor the message to all of these different groups so it is often better to narrow down target audiences to ensure that your message is specific to them.

Another change I made in response to the comments I received during my interviews was narrowing down text, particuraly text that was a repeat of what the data visualizations already conveyed. While I still kept much of the text size, there were places where I did shorten the text or made it more concise. In Part II some of my text was a repeat of what was already clearly explained in the title of my data visualizations, so I deleted that text and let the visualizations speak for themselves. 

I also added two more data visualizations to the beginning since Part II, which are the Average Debt Per Student in the United States and the Average Debt Per State in the United States. I felt that these vsiualizations were important to add in order to personalize even further the debt that each student has and also to showcase the specific student loan debt numbers rather than just the general total U.S. student loan debt.
