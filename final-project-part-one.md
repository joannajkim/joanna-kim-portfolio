# Outline
## Summary

Student loan debt is “now one of the largest forms of consumer borrowing”<sup>1</sup> -second to mortgage debt and even above credit card debt and auto loan debt- and the total debt of “forty-three million U.S. borrowers” (“roughly one in five Americans) is at $1.6 trillion “as of the first quarter of 2024.”<sup>2</sup> With private loans, the amount is above $1.7 trillion.<sup>3</sup> This is 42% more than a decade ago.<sup>4</sup> Student debt is increasing because more students are attending college than before and because “the average student is taking on more debt” due to “college tuition growing many times faster than income”.<sup>5</sup> 
This is problematic because there are longer-term implications of taking out a student loan and improper financial responsibility. For example, home lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio and if the debt is “considered too high to afford additional monthly mortgage payments, a lender will likely reject your loan application.” <sup>6</sup> Another example is lower credit scores due to late payments which can lead “lenders less likely to extend you credit like an auto loan or mortgage”, “lenders only approving you for their higher interest rates”, and “higher insurance rates.”<sup>7</sup> 
 
In my project, I want to convey the story of the large-scale impact of student debt by showcasing the differences in the amount of student debt depending on certain demographics. Therefore, in my project, I will use data related to the progression of the average amount of student loan debt by year, the number of borrowers by year, average debt by age, average debt by location, average debt by race, and average debt by major. 
 
I want to inspire the following potential calls to action through this project: financial literacy and/or counseling to become better at money management and income-driven repayment plans, inspiring employers to provide repayment benefits, and advocating for loan forgiveness programs.<sup>8</sup> 



## Project structure

**One sentence summary**: Student loan debt is a larger problem than we may realize.

**Set Up**: Student debt is the second largest form of consumer borrowing- behind mortgage debt.<sup>9</sup> 

The factors that contribute to the student debt crisis include, “rising tuition fees, housing, and health care costs”, students having “easier access to education loans”, “state funding for higher education has declined”, and “college degrees are losing value.”<sup>10</sup>   

Student loan debt affects a large portion of Americans. It is a catch-22 because taking out loans is sometimes the only way to be able to afford higher education for most students- a higher education that is seemingly ironically required for career advancement and potential for higher salaries. It doesn’t only impact the amount of debt and net worth you have, it has impacts that affect so many other aspects of your financial health and livelihood. Individuals take out debt before their 20s and therefore, are left with the burden of paying loans in their early 20s and 30s which delays many milestones, such as career development and major life decisions. <sup>11</sup>  

**Conflict**: 43 million U.S. borrowers owe “more than $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.”<sup>12</sup> 

The total student loan debt has only increased from 2011-2024.<sup>13</sup> The student loan debt per student has increased since 2017, from $27,260 (adjusted for inflation) to $37,850 in May 2024.<sup>14</sup> The percentage of enrolled students that have borrowed has decreased over time but the average debt per borrower is higher in 2022.<sup>15</sup>

The scope of the student debt crisis is largely seen in its disparities of the amount of debt among different demographics, including by state, race, income level, and age. 

**Resolution**: There are many ways students can mitigate their student debt however, “col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties and employ­ers can take to lessen the bur­den of stu­dent loans on borrowers.”<sup>16</sup> 

“55% of Americans support cancellation of up to $10,000 per borrower in federal student loans” and “47% support cancellation of up to $50,000 per borrower” so a potential solution can be to advocate for policies surrounding student loan forgiveness.<sup>17</sup> 

Colleges and employers can be a part of the solution:
“Limiting tuition rates at public colleges”, giving more grants and tuition waivers for lower-income students, offering student loan repayment benefits, providing financial counseling.<sup>18</sup>

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
