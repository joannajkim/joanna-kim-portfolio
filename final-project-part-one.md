# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
 The definition of fast fashion is “cheaply produced and priced garments that copy the latest catwalk styles and get pumped quickly through stores in order to maximize on current trends.”<sup>1</sup> The most common famous fast fashion brands “include Zara, Shein, UNIQLO, Forever 21, and H&M.”<sup>2</sup> Its “business model involves rapid design, production, distribution and marketing” so these brands can produce “large quantities of greater product variety and allow consumers to get more style and product differentiation at a low price.”<sup>3</sup> 
 
 Although fast fashion is convenient and cheap- which is quite attractive to consumers- it comes at a price. It has a large negative impact on the environment that is largely ignored or unrealized. The business model results in excessive consumption because cheap clothing has shorter life spans and because consumers who want to keep up with the latest trends would much rather splurge on cheaper goods as opposed to “high quality, long lasting items that will very shortly fall out of popularity.”<sup>4</sup> While the business model logically makes sense, this is where the problem arises. The constant “cycle of buying and discarding” due to fast fashion leads to “accumulating mountains of textile and clothing waste every day” especially as most are not biodegradable.<sup>5</sup>
 
 In my project, I want to convey the story of the negative environmental impact of fast fashion through data that displays the waste created. Therefore, in my project, I will showcase data related to garment usage lifetime and how it has decreased with an increase in sales of clothing<sup>6</sup>, CO2 emissions from fast fashion, consumption and pollution of water from textile dyeing<sup>7</sup>, how much textiles waste is produced yearly<sup>8</sup>, and production of microplastics due to discarded synthetic clothing and washing of synthetic clothing<sup>9</sup>. I would also like to discuss the social impact resulting from fast fashion, such as “forced and child labor” since “rapid production means that sales and profits supersede human welfare.<sup>10</sup>
 
 I want to inspire the following calls to action in my project: reading labels and tags on clothing to make sure “100 percent out of natural, regenerative materials, such as cotton, wool, hemp, or linen”<sup>11</sup>, utilizing washing machine bags “to reduce the amount of microfiber shedding of your clothes by 86 percent”<sup>12</sup>, and “supporting environmental organizations”[^13] and “spread awareness of climate crisis”<sup>13</sup>.


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.  

Text here...

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
