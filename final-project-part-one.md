# Outline
## Summary

Student loan debt is “now one of the largest forms of consumer borrowing”<sup>1</sup> -second to mortgage debt and even above credit card debt and auto loan debt- and the total debt of “forty-three million U.S. borrowers” (“roughly one in five Americans”) is at $1.6 trillion “as of the first quarter of 2024.”<sup>2</sup> This is 42% more than a decade ago.<sup>3</sup> Student debt is increasing because more students are attending college than before and because “the average student is taking on more debt” due to “college tuition growing many times faster than income”.<sup>4</sup> 

This is problematic because there are longer-term implications of taking out a student loan. For example, home lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio and if the debt is “considered too high to afford additional monthly mortgage payments, a lender will likely reject your loan application.” <sup>5</sup> Another example is lower credit scores due to late payments which can lead “lenders less likely to extend you credit like an auto loan or mortgage”, “lenders only approving you for their higher interest rates”, and “higher insurance rates.”<sup>6</sup> 
 
In my project, I want to convey the story of the prevalence of student loan debt and how it is impacting the milestones and futures of students post-graduation, including abilities to buy homes, bankruptcy, delayed financial decisions, and mental health. I also want to highlight the disparities among different demographics (age, race, gender) in the level of impact of these factors from student loan debt. 

Although I want to inspire financial literacy and/or counseling to become better at money management and income-driven repayment plans for students, another audience that I would like to target are employers and to inspire them to provide loan repayment benefits, “tie payments to retirement plans”, and even offering education reimbursement to encourage individuals to pursue higher education.<sup>7</sup> Another audience I would like to target are colleges and universities. I want to inspire them to reduce the cost of attendance, provide more financial aid (especially for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds), and offer financial counseling during school years. 

## Project structure

**One sentence summary**: Student loan debt is a larger problem than we may realize and it has a trickle down effect in its impact on people’s lives.

**Set Up**: Student debt is the second largest form of consumer borrowing- behind mortgage debt.<sup>8</sup> 

The factors that contribute to the student debt crisis include, “rising tuition fees, housing, and health care costs”, students having “easier access to education loans”, declining “state funding for higher education”, and how “college degrees are losing value.”<sup>9</sup>   

Student loan debt affects a large portion of Americans. It is a catch-22 because taking out loans is sometimes the only way to be able to afford higher education for most students- a higher education that is ironically seemingly required for career advancement and potential for higher salaries.  

**Conflict**: 43 million U.S. borrowers owe “more than $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.”<sup>10</sup> 

The total student loan debt has only increased from 2011-2024.<sup>11</sup> 

Student loan debt doesn’t only impact the amount of debt you have (which is already concerning because since 2016, the Debt-to-Income ratio among Bachelor’s Degree Earners is twice the “healthy” amount of 36%), it also impacts so many other aspects of students’ livelihood.<sup>12</sup> 

Individuals take out debt before their 20s and therefore, are left with the burden of paying loans in their early 20s and 30s which delays major life milestones such as employment decisions, homeownership, purchasing a car, and starting families, negatively impacts mental health.<sup>13</sup> 

Also, related to these milestones, there are different obstacles for borrowers of different demographics in terms of the level of impact of student loan debt. For example, based upon a study, “43% of borrowers struggle to repay their loans” but “struggle was particularly high among Black and LatinX borrowers, borrowers without a bachelor’s degree, and women.”<sup>14</sup> 

**Resolution**: There are many ways students can mitigate their student debt; however, colleges, universities, and employers can also help to support and “lessen the bur­den of stu­dent loans on borrowers.”<sup>15</sup> 

For students, make sure you understand and know what you owe, make a budget and “see how your student loans fit into your finances”, choose the best federal repayment plan for you, and seek out credit counseling nonprofits.<sup>16</sup>  

Alsom “55% of Americans support cancellation of up to $10,000 per borrower in federal student loans” and “47% support cancellation of up to $50,000 per borrower” so a potential solution can be to advocate to policymakers policies surrounding student loan forgiveness.<sup>17</sup> 

Colleges and employers can be a part of the solution:
“Limiting tuition rates at public colleges”, giving more grants and tuition waivers for lower-income students, offering student loan repayment benefits, providing financial counseling.<sup>18</sup> 
 
## Initial sketches

These are my initial sketches. These were created in google sheets but for the final project, I anticipate that I will be using Tableau to create these graphs. I will add more detail and clean-up the graphs to follow good design practices but for now, I have focused on trying to convey my story arc with the titles. 

# The data
The data I collected are from various websites. This is a link to a google spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing. 
This is where I have taken publicly-accessible data from different websites and added them into separate sheets in this spreadsheet (each sheet is a different set of data from a different website). Some of the data is added exactly from datasets/tables from a website and for these, underneath the tables, I have put "Source: 'link to website'". For the other data, I have created my own tables from pulling bits of data from one website. For these, underneath the tables, I have put "Data Collated From: 'link to website'". Each sheet is labeled with the title of the dataset and this also corresponds with the "name" for the table below. 

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
|"Student Loan Debt (per Student) at Graduation by Year"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing| With this dataset, I want to convey the continuing increase in student loan debt per student over the years. I wanted to include this data as well as the total student loan debt because I think it can make the data more personal as you can see the debt per person rather than collated as an total student debt.|
|"Total Student Loan Debt From 2011-2023"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This dataset showcases the total student loan debt and how it has increased every year since 2011.|
|"Debt-to-Income Ratio Among Bachelor’s Degree Earners at Graduation"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data shows the Debt-to-Income Ratio for Bachelor's Degree Earners. I think it would be interesting to include this data because the "healthy" DTI is 36% and the DTI has been higher than 36% every year from 2007-2022. This data can show the  evolution of how student loan debt can impact borrowers and also, the monetary affects of student loan debt.|
|"Student Loans and Delays in Milestone"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data shows how student loan debt has impacted the ability for adults to reach important milestones. I think this data can help convey the narrative that student loan debt doesn't just impact monetary means but also impacts other areas of life, even after graduating.|
|"71% of Student Loan Borrowers Say Loans Have Delayed at Least One Life Event"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data shows different demographic groups and the percentage of those who felt that student loan debt delayed one or more life events. I think this data would be interesting to include because you can see the disparities between different demographics. I also think this data can help further convey the message that student loan debt does impact the ability to achieve major life events and milestones.|
|"Even Relatively Low Student Loan Amounts Cause Borrowers to Delay Life Events"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data segments the borrowing levels of student loans and the percentage of those who felt that student loans delayed one or more life events. This data conveys that even for those who do not borrow a great amount, they still do feel like student loan debt has impacted their lives negatively in terms of achieving life events.|
|"To what extent does your student loan debt negatively affect your mental health?"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data displays the impact of student loan debt on mental health, separated by male vs. female. This data conveys that more than half of male and female borrowers feel negative affects from student loans- with females affected more negatively.|
|"Has student loan debt affected your employment decisions in any of the following ways?"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data displays student loan debt's affect on employment decisions for different generations, races, and genders. It is interesting to note the disparities by demographic but also, student loan debt also affects the types of jobs people are choosing.|
|"Race/ethnicity differences in struggle with loans"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data shows the differences in struggles with loans based on race/ethnicity, degree level, and gender differences. This further conveys the story that a large portion of borrowers are impacted in negative ways by student loan debt and that there are disparities between different demographics.|
|"Supporting Federal Student Loan Debt Relief"|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16zxtP2D1t_iSKIE3H29WRelo45eteecZi56gFrqcUJw/edit?usp=sharing|This data shows borrowers that support federal student loan debt relief. This can convey that many borrowers do want relief and advocating to policymakers may be one of the many potential solutions to the student debt crisis.|
|"Portfolio by Age and Debt Size"|https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio|This dataset shows debt size by age group and the number of borrowers by age group. I think it may be interesting to compare the debt size and different age groups.|

# Method and medium
I will create my final project in shorthand and I will create my data visualizations in Tableau and datawrapper. My outline will be the natural progression of the story and my call to action will include links to websites related to financial aid counseling, advocacy groups, and scholarships. I will embed the data visualizations and will upload images as well.
