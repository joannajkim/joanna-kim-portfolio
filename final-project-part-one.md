# Outline
## Summary

The definition of fast fashion is “cheaply produced and priced garments that copy the latest catwalk styles and get pumped quickly through stores in order to maximize on current trends.” [^1] The most common famous fast fashion brands “include Zara, Shein, UNIQLO, Forever 21, and H&M.”[^2] Its “business model involves rapid design, production, distribution and marketing” so these brands can produce “large quantities of greater product variety and allow consumers to get more style and product differentiation at a low price.”[^3] 

In my project, I want to convey the story of the negative environmental impact of fast fashion through data that displays the waste created. Therefore, in my project, I will showcase data related to garment usage lifetime and how it has decreased with an increase in sales of clothing[^6], CO2 emissions from fast fashion, consumption and pollution of water from textile dyeing[^7], how much textiles waste is produced yearly[^8], and production of microplastics due to discarded synthetic clothing and washing of synthetic clothing[^9]. I would also like to discuss the social impact resulting from fast fashion, such as “forced and child labor” since “rapid production means that sales and profits supersede human welfare.[^10]

I want to inspire the following calls to action in my project: reading labels and tags on clothing to make sure “100 percent out of natural, regenerative materials, such as cotton, wool, hemp, or linen”[^11], utilizing washing machine bags “to reduce the amount of microfiber shedding of your clothes by 86 percent”[^12], and “supporting environmental organizations”[^13]  and “spread awareness of climate crisis”[^14].


## Project structure

**One sentence summary**: Although fast fashion is convenient and cheap, it comes at a price of environmental impact. 

**Set Up**: Fast fashion is convenient and cheap therefore, attractive to consumers.

It has grown 10.74% from 2024-2025 and is “now a $150.82 billion industry”.<sup>15</sup> It is projected “to reach $194.96 billion by 2027”.<sup>16</sup>  

In March 2022, Shein had 50% market share in the United States, with H&M, Zara, Fashion Nova, and Forever 21 following, and was also “second fastest growing e-commerce website in the world in 2022.”<sup>17</sup>  
 
**Conflict**: The environmental footprint from fast fashion is quickly increasing as well. 

To make one cotton t-shirt, it can take “2,700 liters of water” which is “equivalent to what one person might drink over three years.”<sup>17</sup>  To make a pair of jeans, “it takes 3,781 liters of water” and “equates to the emission of around 33.5 kilograms of carbon equivalent.”<sup>18</sup>  Annually, the fashion industry uses 93 billion cubic metres of water-”enough to meet the needs of five million people.”<sup>19</sup>  The clothing and textile industry consume “around 215 trillion liters of water per year”, is “responsible for 2-8% of world’s greenhouse gas emissions”, contributes $100 billion “in annual material loss due to underutilisation”, and “textiles account for approximately 9% of annual microplastic losses to the oceans.”<sup>20</sup> 

Textiles generate large amounts of waste in landfills: 
92 million out of 100 billion garments produced end up in landfills which is “equivalent of a rubbish truck full of clothes ends up on landfill sites every second.”<sup>21</sup>

Lots of Air and water pollution from CO2 emissions and microplastics<sup>22</sup>:
A report in 2018 by Quantis International “found that the three main drivers of the industry’s global pollution impacts were dyeing and finishing (36%), yarn preparation (28%) and fibre production (15%)”.<sup>23</sup>
CO2e emissions are projected to reach 1.243 billion metric tons by 2030. <sup>24</sup>

**Resolution**: Join the “Slow Fashion” Movement. This can include washing clothes “on the lowest heat setting” and “hanging to dry to save on energy”, “wearing second-hand clothing”, “shopping mindfully”, and “being aware of companies’ greenwashing tactics.”<sup>25</sup> 

Using washing machine bags can “reduce microfibre release by 86 percent” and if a product called “The Cora Ball” is used by “10% of U.S. households” during laundry, “it would prevent the equivalent of 30 million water bottles from entering waterways per year.”<sup>26</sup>
