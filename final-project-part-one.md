# Outline
## Summary

Student loan debt is “now one of the largest forms of consumer borrowing”<sup>1</sup> -second to mortgage debt and even above credit card debt and auto loan debt- and the total debt of “forty-three million U.S. borrowers” (“roughly one in five Americans”) is at $1.6 trillion “as of the first quarter of 2024.”<sup>2</sup> This is 42% more than a decade ago.<sup>3</sup> Student debt is increasing because more students are attending college than before and because “the average student is taking on more debt” due to “college tuition growing many times faster than income”.<sup>4</sup> 

This is problematic because there are longer-term implications of taking out a student loan. For example, home lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio and if the debt is “considered too high to afford additional monthly mortgage payments, a lender will likely reject your loan application.” <sup>5</sup> Another example is lower credit scores due to late payments which can lead “lenders less likely to extend you credit like an auto loan or mortgage”, “lenders only approving you for their higher interest rates”, and “higher insurance rates.”<sup>6</sup> 
 
In my project, I want to convey the story of the prevalence of student loan debt and how it is impacting the lives of students post-graduation, including abilities to buy homes, bankruptcy, delayed financial decisions, and mental health. I also want to highlight the disparities among different demographics (age, race, major) in the level of impact of student loan debt. 

Although I want to inspire financial literacy and/or counseling to become better at money management and income-driven repayment plans for students, another audience that I would like to target are employers and to inspire them to provide loan repayment benefits, “tie payments to retirement plans”, and even offering education reimbursement to encourage individuals to pursue higher education.<sup>7</sup> Another audience I would like to target are colleges and universities. I want to inspire them to reduce the cost of attendance, provide more financial aid (especially for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds), and offer financial counseling during school years. 

## Project structure

**One sentence summary**: Student loan debt is a larger problem than we may realize and it has a trickle down effect in its impact on people’s lives.

**Set Up**: Student debt is the second largest form of consumer borrowing- behind mortgage debt.<sup>8</sup> 

The factors that contribute to the student debt crisis include, “rising tuition fees, housing, and health care costs”, students having “easier access to education loans”, declining “state funding for higher education”, and how “college degrees are losing value.”<sup>9</sup>   

Student loan debt affects a large portion of Americans. It is a catch-22 because taking out loans is sometimes the only way to be able to afford higher education for most students- a higher education that is ironically seemingly required for career advancement and potential for higher salaries.  

**Conflict**: 43 million U.S. borrowers owe “more than $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.”<sup>10</sup> 

The total student loan debt has only increased from 2011-2024.<sup>11</sup> 

Student loan debt doesn’t only impact the amount of debt you have (which is already concerning because since 2016, the Debt-to-Income ratio among Bachelor’s Degree Earners is twice the “healthy” amount of 36%), it also impacts so many other aspects of students’ livelihood.<sup>12</sup> 

Individuals take out debt before their 20s and therefore, are left with the burden of paying loans in their early 20s and 30s which delays major life milestones such as employment decisions, homeownership, purchasing a car, and starting families, negatively impacts mental health.<sup>13</sup> 

Also, related to these milestones, there are different obstacles for borrowers of different demographics in terms of the level of impact of student loan debt. For example, based upon a study, “43% of borrowers struggle to repay their loans” but “struggle was particularly high among Black and LatinX borrowers, borrowers without a bachelor’s degree, and women.”<sup>14</sup> 

**Resolution**: There are many ways students can mitigate their student debt; however, colleges, universities, and employers can also help to support and “lessen the bur­den of stu­dent loans on borrowers.”<sup>15</sup> 

For students, make sure you understand and know what you owe, make a budget and “see how your student loans fit into your finances”, choose the best federal repayment plan for you, and seek out credit counseling nonprofits.<sup>16</sup>  

Alsom “55% of Americans support cancellation of up to $10,000 per borrower in federal student loans” and “47% support cancellation of up to $50,000 per borrower” so a potential solution can be to advocate to policymakers policies surrounding student loan forgiveness.<sup>17</sup> 

Colleges and employers can be a part of the solution:
“Limiting tuition rates at public colleges”, giving more grants and tuition waivers for lower-income students, offering student loan repayment benefits, providing financial counseling.<sup>18</sup>
