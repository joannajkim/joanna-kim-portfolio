# Outline
## Summary

Student loan debt is “now one of the largest forms of consumer borrowing”<sup>1</sup>-second to mortgage debt and even above credit card debt and auto loan debt- and the total debt of “forty-three million U.S. borrowers” (“roughly one in five Americans") is at $1.6 trillion “as of the first quarter of 2024.”<sup>2</sup> With private loans, the amount is above $1.7 trillion.<sup>3</sup> This is 42% more than a decade ago.<sup>4</sup> Student debt is increasing because more students are attending college than before and because “the average student is taking on more debt” due to “college tuition growing many times faster than income.”<sup>5</sup> 

This is problematic because there are longer-term implications of taking out a student loan and improper financial responsibility. For example, home lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio and if the debt is “considered too high to afford additional monthly mortgage payments, a lender will likely reject your loan application.”<sup>6</sup> Another example is lower credit scores due to late payments which can lead “lenders less likely to extend you credit like an auto loan or mortgage”, “lenders only approving you for their higher interest rates”, and “higher insurance rates.”<sup>7</sup> 
 
In my project, I want to convey the story of the large-scale prevelance of student debt. Therefore, in my project, I will showcase data related to the progression of the average amount of student loan debt by year, the number of borrowers by year, and  debt in relation to age, location, race, and by major. 
 
I want to inspire the following potential calls to action through this project: financial literacy and/or counseling to become better at money management, income-driven repayment plans, inspiring employers to provide repayment benefits, and advocating for loan forgiveness programs.<sup>8</sup> 

## Project structure

**One sentence summary**: Student loan debt is a larger problem than we may realize.

**Set Up**: 
 
**Conflict**: The environmental footprint from fast fashion is quickly increasing as well. 

To make one cotton t-shirt, it can take “2,700 liters of water” which is “equivalent to what one person might drink over three years.”<sup>17</sup>  To make a pair of jeans, “it takes 3,781 liters of water” and “equates to the emission of around 33.5 kilograms of carbon equivalent.”<sup>18</sup>  Annually, the fashion industry uses 93 billion cubic metres of water-”enough to meet the needs of five million people.”<sup>19</sup>  The clothing and textile industry consume “around 215 trillion liters of water per year”, is “responsible for 2-8% of world’s greenhouse gas emissions”, contributes $100 billion “in annual material loss due to underutilisation”, and “textiles account for approximately 9% of annual microplastic losses to the oceans.”<sup>20</sup> 

Textiles generate large amounts of waste in landfills:
92 million out of 100 billion garments produced end up in landfills which is “equivalent of a rubbish truck full of clothes ends up on landfill sites every second.”<sup>21</sup>

Lots of Air and water pollution from CO2 emissions and microplastics<sup>22</sup>:
A report in 2018 by Quantis International “found that the three main drivers of the industry’s global pollution impacts were dyeing and finishing (36%), yarn preparation (28%) and fibre production (15%)”.<sup>23</sup>
CO2e emissions are projected to reach 1.243 billion metric tons by 2030. <sup>24</sup>

**Resolution**: Join the “Slow Fashion” Movement. This can include washing clothes “on the lowest heat setting” and “hanging to dry to save on energy”, “wearing second-hand clothing”, “shopping mindfully”, and “being aware of companies’ greenwashing tactics.”<sup>25</sup> 

Using washing machine bags can “reduce microfibre release by 86 percent” and if a product called “The Cora Ball” is used by “10% of U.S. households” during laundry, “it would prevent the equivalent of 30 million water bottles from entering waterways per year.” <sup>26</sup>

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
