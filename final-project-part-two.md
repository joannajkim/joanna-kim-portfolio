# User research 

## Target audience

Due to this project largely focusing on the impacts of the student loan debt, the best audience would be students themselves. In order to identify representative individuals, I think the best way would be to approach students from CMU, particuraly graduate students. Undergraduates may not exprience the after effects of student debt yet but graduate students (since many have worked between graduating undergrad and starting graduate school) likely experience the effects from the student debt they took on during their undergraduate years.  I think it would be interesting to also interview older generations, particuraly GenX, because their experience with student loan debt and therefore, their perspective on student loan debt may be vastly different. Since most graduate students are likely older GenZ or younger millenials, I think having one GenX individual who has taken out student loans would be an interesting perspective to gather. 

I hope to reach students with my story and help them realize that they are not alone in their struggles with student loan debt because varying demographics do struggle in some way with the effects. However, for the bigger picture, I want to reach higher education insitutions, employers, and policymakers so they can see the large negative impact that student loan debt has on the American population and be inspired to take action to combat and help the student loan debt crisis.   

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|My goal is to make sure all perspectives on student loan debt are included and represented accurately.|Is there a piece of information that you feel is missing or needs more clarity?|
|My goal is to have a clear target audience.|Who do you think is the intended audience for this?|
|My goal is to have a clear story and message.|What do you think is the main message of this project?|
|My goal is to have a clear and intuitive navigation through the storyline.|Is there anything you find confusing or not intuitive?|
|My goal is to have data visualizations that actually do help enhance the message.|Do you think the visualizations I chose are the best way to represent the data and convey a clear message?|
|My goal is to make sure that the way my story is told and the use of the data visualizations tell a compelling story.|Is there anything you would change, do differently, or add?|

## Interview findings

| Questions | MEIM student, mid 20s| MAM student, mid 20s | Parent, early 40s, not a student currently but still paying student loans.|
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Is there a piece of information that you feel is missing or needs more clarity?|Everything is there- data and text wise- but it may be too much information for this presentation. Too large of a scope for this project.|Design needs the most work since the graphs and information are already there. Cleaning up the cohesiveness of the color and design choices in shorthand would create less visual distraction.|Lots of great and interesting information. Information is not necessarily missing but I would make it more concise and less text to help with the formatting of the slide deck.|
|Who do you think is the intended audience for this?|Policymakers to enact laws to help current students and graduates.|Students and American government. Bringing awareness about student loans and long-term impact.|Students and policymakers. Although, the end of your project shows recommendations for students, policymakers, higher education insitutions, and employers so possibly narrow down to one audience and mae sure your content is catered towards whomever that is.|
|What do you think is the main message of this project?|Student loans consequences; disparities in consequences; many aspects of student loans have long-term effects.|Impacts of student loans. Disparities between gender stuck out to me the most.|Student loan debt and the impact on former students' future.|             
|Is there anything you find confusing or not intuitive?|There are too many data points. Focus on one aspect or take some aspects away. Having more overarching ideas to guide the audience through the story.|The information is in large blocks of text so it's too long. Make the information more concise and have more visual elements. It doesn't seem like the information would fit in a brief presentation.|The colors reflect the United States but I would use more consistent design choices. Each section can have own color and title like a powerpoint presentation with slides.|      
|Do you think the visualizations I chose are the best way to represent the data and convey a clear message?|Yes. Clear visualizations and descriptive titles.|Agree with Interviewee 1.|Lots of good data to convince policymakers of your viewpoiint. The graphs have clear headers and graphs help move the story. Bullets next to graphs are unnecessary for most of the slides because the graphs show clear information.|
|Is there anything you would change, do differently, or add?|Instead of having text that repeats what the graphs show, do more concise bullet points or let graphs speak for themselves if it's self-explanatory. For example, letting descriptive title for graphs can be enough instead of having to add text to explain what is obvious to audience. Have less text heavy components. "Seems more like a report right now, change it to read like a presentation."|"Have titles for each section, like chapters in a book. Have an overall title/big header to physically separate each chunk of information and graph."|"Add narratives from real people who struggle with student loans because it can make the issue seem more real to policymakers and help them symphasize."|


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis| Anticipated changes for Part III |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|One of the themes from the interviews was design choice. It seems that the use of all of the colors in the design of shorthand are not consistent and a bit all over the place, which distracts from the narrative.|I will try to fix all of the colors in my design so that they are more organized. I will make clear headers for each new piece of information and designate colors for each header to create consistency.|
|Another theme from the interviews was how text heavy the project was in shorthand.|In order to fix this, I will try to make the text more concise. Particuraly for the graphs, I have a lot of bullet points that directly point out what is obviously shown in the visualizations, so I will remove them or have text that gives more analysis points rather than data points that the audience can figure out themselves.|
|Another theme from the interviews was the breadth of information.|I will try to make all of the information more concise and potentially cut out some data points away in order to make the scope of the project smaller.|
|Another theme from the interviews is confusion around who exactly the audience for this project is.|Currently, I have many different calls to action for different audiences. I think it would make sense to narrow down the audiences. Due to the narrative of the project being the negative effects of student loan debt, instead of being aimed at students, I think it would make more sense to delete the student portion from my current call to action and choose one or more of the other audiences (higher education institutions, employers, and policymakers).|

In terms of final thoughts, I think most of the work for Part 3 will surround reducing the amount of information and telling the story more through my visualizations rather than text. I will work on narrowing down the scope of the project as well as narrowing down my target audiences. My initial thought was that a project surrounding student loan debt would have students as the main audience, but after getting feedback from my interviewees, it seems like it would be more appropriately aligned with the message of my story for the audience to be institutions who can change the impacts of student loan debts, such as policymakers and higher education insitutions themselves. The audience and message directed towards the audience seems to be a point of contention based on the responses of my interviewees so it is definetly an area of the project that is unclear as of now. I will narrow down the audience and make sure my message and visualization are appropriate for that audience.

I will also work on the design element. It seems that the colors and design choices for the template in shorthand are not polished yet and create a bit of chaos in navigating the storyline for the viewer. I will clean up the design and create more consistency in color choices so the design elements don't distract from the narrative.
