# Title

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

This is a link to the original data visualization: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/who-spends-the-most-time-on-social-media/  

I chose this visualization because as I was going through all of the Makeover Monday visualizations, this one particuraly caught my eye due to all of the different colors used. My first thought was that this visualization goes against a lot of the good design practices that we discussed in class and reminded me of a few of the visualizations we looked at in class and for our assignments. I thought that this visualization would be fun to try to do a critque by design of because instead of adding information, much of this redesign would be more about finding a way to convey the same data through a more simple lens. 

I also chose this visualization because I have an interest in marketing (and this likely audience of this visualization is businesses and marketers) and this information is definetly something of value for businesses who may have a more international presence. 

## Step two: the critique

I think this method at evaluating the data visualization was successful and a much more organized and tangible way compared to the Good Charts Method because it allows you to break down the visualization based on different criteria. It made it easier for me to realize the visualizationâ€™s strengths and weaknesses because each criteria allows you to focus on specific aspects of the visualization that you may not otherwise focus on without the guidance of the criteria.



## Step three: Sketch a solution

I was debating between utilizing a horizontal bar chart and a map but ended up with a horizontal bar chart because the only reason I wanted to use a map was to highlight which continents the countries were from (like how the original visualization had grouping the coloring of the countries by continents), which may be helpful for businesses and marketers but not only is it likely information that the intended audience already knows, but also, it seems like unnecessaru information for the context and story this visualization is trying to convey. The main message is focused on the countries and creating a map and adding the information of the continents seems to be too much information for this visualization.

For my redesign using a horizontal bar chart, I chose to design through a lens of simplicity because most of my insights from the critique method of the visualization were that the aethestics itself were overwhelming and create too much eye travel even though the data itself were presented in an intuitive manner for the most part. My overall process was to find ways to remove unncessary elements or elements that do not enhance the main message of the visualization without disrupting the clarity of the message. Thereofre, I decided to remove of all of unnecessary elements I identified in my critique such as the yellow border, creating consistency but keeping hierarchy of text, removing the colors to denote the continents, removing the black background, removing all of the text boxes and graphics, and remocing the flag names. In deciding what to remove vs. keep, I was afraid that I may be removing too much information but I tried to reason that even if the information may be somewhat valuable information, if it is not valuable for the context of this specific visualization, due to simplicity, it may be better to remove any elements that do not serve purpose or enhance the message.

It was interesting to realize that as an outsider critiquing a visualiation, it is easier to remove elements. I tend to struggle with creating visualizations with simplicity and clarity because I have a habit of including a lot of information in my charts because I don't want to miss out on particular piece of information and I also tend to use a large array of colors. Therefore, this was a great exercise to be able to consider what elements were necessary vs. unnecessary in someone else's visualization and hopefully, I can apply what I learned here to my future visualizations. I also realized that a visualization can still be effective, and sometimes even more effective, with simplicity and removing elements. 

I changed the title to "Countries by Average Daily Social Media Use" because the original title neglected to add the word "average". As a subtitle, I also added "based on users aged 16-64" because in the original visualization, it was in the bottom right corner in light colored text so it was hard to see and this type of information seems like it would be important to highlight, especially because demographic information is valuable for those working in marketing and businesses. I chose to use one base color for the bars and decided to use a gradient because it follows conventions where the highest values are in a darker color and the lower values are in a lighter color. I chose to use brown for the color of the bars because it typically evokes earthiness and felt appropriate for data that includes countries. I chose helvetica for all of the fonts for legibility and readibility purposes and also to create consistency within the typography compared to the original visualization.  


## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
