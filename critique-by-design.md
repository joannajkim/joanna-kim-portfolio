# Critique by Design Written Summary
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

This is a link to the original data visualization: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/who-spends-the-most-time-on-social-media/  

This visualization depicts the top countries ranked in a horizontal bar chart from the most to least average daily time spent on social media. There is a yellow border around the visualization and the background is black. The countries are listed by name and the hour and minutes of their average daily time spent. The countries are also grouped by different colors based on whih continents they are from. There are also circle icons of each of the countries' flags. There is a purple box towards the bottom right of the visualization with a fact about social media use. The title has a purple background and one part of the title ("Daily Social Media Use") is separated from the rest of the title in another darker purple 3-D box and is in a different font. On the bottom right of the visualization, in a small font and subdued colors, it says "Based on users aged 17 to 24".

I chose this visualization because as I was going through all of the Makeover Monday visualizations, this one particuraly caught my eye due to all of the different colors used. My first thought was that this visualization goes against a lot of the good design practices that we discussed in class and reminded me of a few of the visualizations we looked at in class and for our assignments. I thought that this visualization would be fun to try to do a critque by design of because instead of adding information, much of this redesign would be more about finding a way to convey the same data through a more simple lens. 

I also chose this visualization because I have an interest in marketing (and this likely audience of this visualization is businesses and marketers) and this information is definetly something of value for businesses who may have a more international presence. 

## Step two: the critique

I think this method at evaluating the data visualization was successful and a much more organized and tangible way compared to the Good Charts Method because it allows you to break down the visualization based on different criteria. It made it easier for me to realize the visualization’s strengths and weaknesses because each criteria allows you to focus on specific aspects of the visualization that you may not otherwise focus on without the guidance of the criteria. This method of critique was a great way to be able to understand the layers of a visualization and that a visualization can have great strengths in one area (such as the intuitiveness of the information presented in this visualization) but also have weaknesses in another (such as the amount of unnecessary eye travel in this visualization). 

For usefulness, I rate this visualization an 9 because while I think this information about the top countries by daily social media use is valuable data to businesses (especially those with an international presence) and those who work in marketing, especially because it displays the specific hours and minutes spent and they can see which countries they may be missing out on their marketing efforts on social media with, I think having a further breakdown of the specific types of social media platforms that these countries spend these hours and minutes on would be even more helpful information for this audience. 

For completeness, I rate this visualization a 8 because the visualization does have all of the information needed to communicate a clear level of understanding for the viewer. Writing out the countries as well as the average daily time spent in hours and minutes and the ranking from top to bottom (which follows conventions and expectations) does convey a clear and intuitive message of the top countries by daily social media use. However, while the message through the bar chart is pretty intuitive for the audience (and even the general public), there is too much unnecessary information that creates too much eye travel and visual distractions, such as the coloring by the continents, the graphics, and the countries' flags. Therefore, I think this visualization would be even more effective if it erred more on the simple side to help clarify the message even more without distractions.

For perceptibility, I rate this visualization a 9 because the information is presented in a clear way through the horizontal bar chart. For example, the top-to-bottom of the ranking of the countries follows expectations and conventions so it is intuitive and easy for the human eye and brain to naturally follow the context of the visualization and understand what it is trying to convey with minimal effort and precision. However, one area of the chart that could be improved is the use of colors. The use of the colors of the bars to denote the different continents is unnecessary and creates too much eye travel that may cause confusion for the audience at first glance. 

For truthfulness, I rate this visualization a 10. In terms of accuracy, I think the length of the bar lines are precise because each bar length increases as it goes up the chart in representing the increase in average daily time spent and there are no vast exaggerations that lead the data to be misrepresented or comparisons that aren't correct. In terms of validity, the title of the graph is “Top Countries by Daily Social Media Use” and the visualization, with the ranking of the countries by average daily time spent on social media from top to bottom, does represent what it claims. 

For intuitiveness, I rate this visualization a 8. I think the visualization is very intuitive for the main audience and also for the general public, especially as the countries are ranked visually from top-to-bottom in order of decreasing average daily time spent on social media so it follows western conventions and expectations that rankings are usually top-to-bottom and we would find the top of the graph to be those of the most numerical values when ranking. This visualization communicates the message clearly in a quick glance by the viewer, without further and longer analysis, which means it is quite intuitive. However, one less intuitive portion of the visualization- the color choices to signify the different continents because there seems to be no intention behind the uses of the colors and seem a bit random so the viewer can easily be confused by what the colors mean if they didn’t have the key at the bottom. A more intuitive way to use colors for the ranking would be using a gradient such as using darker colors for the higher average daily time spent fading to lighter colors. 

For aesthetics, I rate this visualization a 3 because while the visualization is eye-catching due to the number of colors it uses and graphics that pop out from the black background, it is not eye-catching in a effective way. For example, these colors and graphics overwhelm the visualization and are distracting from the message the visualization is trying to convey. The different colors utilized throughout the visualization create too much eye travel and unnecessary complications that do not support or help enhance the overall message of the visualization. For example, with the country flag icons, the chart uses every color of the rainbow so this chart could limit its color use. The yellow border takes too much real estate and goes against expectations because even though it is highlighted in yellow (and with western conventions, yellow is used to highlight), it serves no purpose. Also, with colors, we tend to expect that alike colors signify alike values or ideas, but the use of purple is used in the title, text box, and to denote Africa countries so it provides further confusion and even more eye travel from viewers that may try to decipher the color choices. 

For engagement, I rate this visualization a 6 because it is an interesting topic to see the ranking of the countries by their social media use, especially would be valuable information for its target audience. It is also fairly intuitive and quick to understand the message the visualization is communicating. However, there are other elements, such as the different uses of color and inclusion of unnecessary information, that create a bit of eye travel for the viewer that distracts and detracts from the invitation to examine the information. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

### Workflow Step 1: This is my first draft potential visualizations. I think a map may be a potential visualization as it shows the continents of the countries in a more visual manner rather than listing out the continents or using colors to denote the continents like the original visualization did. However, the map creates a barrier to the intutiveness and ease of getting information about the average daily time spent because the map itself overwhelms the actual information. This is an issue because the main story is about the average daily time spent, not the countries or continents themselves, so I do not think this visualization is effective.

</script>

### Workflow Step 2: After creating the map, I decided to stick with using a horizontal bar chart like the original visualization. This includes information about the continents but in a horizontal bar chart. I think this version is not intuitive and too complicated because the bars are not in the correct order by average daily time due to the inclusion of the information of the continents. Also, because grouping by continents doesn't allow the bars to be in order by average daily time, I cannot use a color gradient, which would be more intuitive since greater values are conventionally associated with darker colors and lower values are associated with lighter colors so this version is a less intuitive visualization. This leads me to think that adding the information of the continents is unnecessary and creates unncessary eye travel therefore, complicating the visualization further.

  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
</script>

### Workflow Step 3: I decided to play around with different types of charts. I tried a treemap and while it is a great visual way to display the different average time spent through the different sizes of the boxes, based on the truthfulness aspect of the data visualization effectiveness profile, I dont think it would meet the accuracy portion because the different sizes are ambigious and hard to compare the exact differences between the average time spent. Therefore, I still think a horizontal bar chart may be the most effective way to display the story of the differences in average time spent between the countries because of its clarity and intuitveness of the top-to-bottom design.

### First Draft of Critique by Design: This is my first official draft of the critique by design and the one I will use to receive feedback. 
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1739074899064' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Countries by Average Daily Social Media UseBased on users aged 16-24  ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fi&#47;FirstDraftCritiquebyDesign-JoannaKim&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='FirstDraftCritiquebyDesign-JoannaKim&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Fi&#47;FirstDraftCritiquebyDesign-JoannaKim&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>

The primary audience for this visualization is businesses (especially those who have an international presence) and specifically, their marketing teams because marketing utilizes social media platforms and this visualization may be helpful in determining which countries the businesses should target to engage or expand their engagement with through social media depending on which countries have higher daily time spent on social media. I think this visualization is effective for reaching this audience due to its intuitive presentation of the data through the decreasing order of the bars that allows for ease of comparison and the written out average time spent on social media. 

I was debating between utilizing a horizontal bar chart and a map but ended up with a horizontal bar chart because the only reason I wanted to use a map was to highlight which continents the countries were from (like how the original visualization had grouping the coloring of the countries by continents), which may be helpful for businesses and marketers but not only is it likely information that the intended audience already knows, but also, it is unnecessary information for the context and story this visualization is trying to convey since based on the title, the focus is on the top countries, not continents. The main message is focused on the countries and creating a map and adding the information of the continents seems to be too much information for this visualization. Also, because the main message of the visualization is the top countries and their rankings in their daily social media use, I think a horizontal bar chart rather than a map would communicate that information more clearly and quickly because it allows the viewer to see a clear visual comparison between the different countries and their average daily time spent. 

For my redesign using a horizontal bar chart, based upon my critique, I chose to design through a lens of simplicity because most of my insights from the critique method of the visualization were that the aethestics itself were overwhelming and create too much eye travel even though the data itself were presented in an intuitive manner for the most part. 

My overall process was to find ways to remove unncessary elements or elements that do not enhance the main message of the visualization without disrupting the clarity of the message. Therefore, I decided to remove of all of unnecessary elements that created eye travel that I had identified in my critique such as the yellow border, creating consistency but keeping hierarchy of text, removing the colors to denote the continents, removing the black background, removing all of the text boxes and graphics, and removing the flag names. In deciding what elements of the original visualization to remove vs. keep, I was afraid that I may be removing too much information but I tried to reason that even if the information may be somewhat valuable information, if it is not valuable for the context of this specific visualization, due to simplicity, it may be better to remove any elements that do not serve purpose or enhance the message. Also, businesses and marketers are likely busy so when thinking about their time and what visualization may be the most effective clarity-wise and effective in getting only valuable and neccessary information to this audience the quickest, removing information would be more practical for this audience.

It was interesting to realize that as an outsider critiquing a visualiation, it is easier to remove elements. I tend to struggle with creating visualizations with simplicity and clarity because I have a habit of including a lot of information in my charts because I don't want to miss out on particular piece of information and I also tend to use a large array of colors. Therefore, this was a great exercise to be able to consider what elements were necessary vs. unnecessary in someone else's visualization and hopefully, I can apply what I learned here to my future visualizations. I also realized that a visualization can still be effective, and sometimes even more effective, with simplicity and removing elements. 

I changed the title to "Countries by Average Daily Social Media Use" because the original title neglected to add the word "average". As a subtitle, I also added "based on users aged 16-64" because in the original visualization, it was in the bottom right corner in light colored text so it was hard to see and this type of information seems like it would be important to highlight, especially because demographic information is valuable for those working in marketing and businesses. I chose to use one base color for the bars and decided to use a gradient because it follows conventions where the highest values are in a darker color and the lower values are in a lighter color. I chose to use brown for the color of the bars because it typically evokes earthiness and felt appropriate for data that includes countries. I chose helvetica for all of the fonts for legibility and readibility purposes and also to create consistency within the typography compared to the original visualization.  


## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask: 

- What do you think this visualization is trying to portray?

- Is there anything you find confusing or not intuitive?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

- Compared to the original visualization, do you think this is more effective or do you think it takes too much information away and is too simple?

- Do you think a map would be more efficient to represent this information?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | MISM, mid-20s |MISM-BIDA, early 20s|MISM, early 20s|
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|What do you think this visualization is trying to portray?|List of countries who spend the most time on social media.|Agreed with 1st student.|Agreed with 1st student.|
|Is there anything you find confusing or not intuitive?|Who the data is gathered from is unclear. Is it per capital or gathered from a population? Also unclear if there were more countries a part of this data.|Story is unclear. There is no storytelling, seems like it just shows the data. The title is redudant with the X-axis. Maybe create a line that separates the top few countries and highlight those countries.|You should choose a story and stick with it.|
|Who do you think is the intended audience for this?|Agreed with 3rd student.|Agreed with 3rd student.     |Social media agencies or marketing.|
|Is there anything you would change or do differently?|The color choice of brown is reminiscent of skin tone so should change to green for land. Pick a story and stick with it and whatever it is, make sure the data reflects it.|Pick a story angle and change the visualization based on it. For example, highlight Kenya and create a border around it to point it out. Change the title to display an idea rather than just state what the data says.|The color would be better in blue because since this visualization is directed towards social media companies, blue is for a lot of social media companies so it's a familiar company.|
|Compared to the original visualization, do you think this is more effective or do you think it takes too much information away and is too simple?|I agree with everything you took away from the original visualiation.|Yes but maybe include the purple box with the fact if it helps tell whatever story angle you decide to chose.|I like keeping the country's flags. Keeping continents may be helpful, for example, do the average social media use for each continentn in a separate key in the visualization.|
|Do you think a map would be more efficient to represent this information?|Agreed with 3rd person.|Agreed with 3rd person.|No, this is better than a map because it would overcomplicate the visualization.|

Synthesis: 
One pattern that emerged from the feedback is the lack of a story represented in my data. I realize now that I got a bit too stuck in the data that I forgot the storytelling aspect of the critique by design. I learned that I need to pick a story and make sure that whatever angle I decide to take from the data, I should make sure the visualization conveys it. Also, in the same idea, with my title, it should convey an idea rather than directly state what is happening in the visualization. Another pattern that emerged was the color choice. One person mentioned that the gradient brown of the bars reminds them of different skin colors, which I didn't even think about when creating the 1st draft sketch of the visualization and I am glad they had brought this up because it may send a wrong message. It made me realize that color can have different meanings and evoke different things to different people, so I should be more careful with my color choice in the future. I really liked someone's idea to use blue because it is a familiar color to social media companies since many social media platforms use blue. This also made me realize to think about the intended audience when thinking about color choice and which colors may be most familiar to them or representative of that audience. 

Based on all of the feedback, I learned that I need to improve on the storytelling aspect. My 1st draft visualization was more focused on presenting the data through a general lens instead of telling a specific story and I think based on my feedback, my interviewee's really yearned for something further than just a representation of general data with no meaning. I realized that it is so easy to get stuck on the data that I forgot making sure that the visualization is actually telling a story from some angle. Therefore, for my final solution, I will create a visualization through the story of how 3 out of the 5 countries for the most social media use are from Africa. To also reflect this story and in response to the feedback I received, I will change the title to "Africa holds 3 of the top 5 spots for social media use. Also, to reflect this new tite and in response to one of the comments regarding highlighting certain countries based on what story I will tell, I will bold the border in black of the countries from Africa of the top 5 so that my visualization matches my story. I will also change the color of the bars from brown to blue based upon my comments because I liked that the reasoning was related to the target audience. I will also make sure to write in the subtitle that the results were the result of a survey compiled by We Are Social and are from internet users aged 16-64 as of January 2024 since one of the comments was confusion regarding where the results were from. 

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
