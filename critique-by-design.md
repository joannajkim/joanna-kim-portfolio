# Critique by Design Written Summary
Text here...

_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization

This is a link to the original data visualization: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/who-spends-the-most-time-on-social-media/  

This visualization depicts the top countries ranked in a horizontal bar chart from the most to least average daily time spent on social media. There is a yellow border around the visualization and the background is black. The countries are listed by name and the hour and minutes of their average daily time spent. The countries are also grouped by different colors based on whih continents they are from. There are also circle icons of each of the countries' flags. There is a purple box towards the bottom right of the visualization with a fact about social media use. The title has a purple background and one part of the title ("Daily Social Media Use") is separated from the rest of the title in another darker purple 3-D box and is in a different font. On the bottom right of the visualization, in a small font and subdued colors, it says "Based on users aged 17 to 24".

I chose this visualization because as I was going through all of the Makeover Monday visualizations, this one particuraly caught my eye due to all of the different colors used. My first thought was that this visualization goes against a lot of the good design practices that we discussed in class and reminded me of a few of the visualizations we looked at in class and for our assignments. I thought that this visualization would be fun to try to do a critque by design of because instead of adding information, much of this redesign would be more about finding a way to convey the same data through a more simple lens. 

I also chose this visualization because I have an interest in marketing (and this likely audience of this visualization is businesses and marketers) and this information is definetly something of value for businesses who may have a more international presence. 

## Step two: the critique

I think this method at evaluating the data visualization was successful and a much more organized and tangible way compared to the Good Charts Method because it allows you to break down the visualization based on different criteria. It made it easier for me to realize the visualization’s strengths and weaknesses because each criteria allows you to focus on specific aspects of the visualization that you may not otherwise focus on without the guidance of the criteria. This method of critique was a great way to be able to understand the layers of a visualization and that a visualization can have great strengths in one area (such as the intuitiveness of the information presented in this visualization) but also have weaknesses in another (such as the amount of unnecessary eye travel in this visualization). 

For usefulness, I rate this visualization an 9 because while I think this information about the top countries by daily social media use is valuable data to businesses (especially those with an international presence) and those who work in marketing, especially because it displays the specific hours and minutes spent and they can see which countries they may be missing out on their marketing efforts on social media with, I think having a further breakdown of the specific types of social media platforms that these countries spend these hours and minutes on would be even more helpful information for this audience. 

For completeness, I rate this visualization a 8 because the visualization does have all of the information needed to communicate a clear level of understanding for the viewer. Writing out the countries as well as the average daily time spent in hours and minutes and the ranking from top to bottom (which follows conventions and expectations) does convey a clear and intuitive message of the top countries by daily social media use. However, while the message through the bar chart is pretty intuitive for the audience (and even the general public), there is too much unnecessary information that creates too much eye travel and visual distractions, such as the coloring by the continents, the graphics, and the countries' flags. Therefore, I think this visualization would be even more effective if it erred more on the simple side to help clarify the message even more without distractions.

For perceptibility, I rate this visualization a 9 because the information is presented in a clear way through the horizontal bar chart. For example, the top-to-bottom of the ranking of the countries follows expectations and conventions so it is intuitive and easy for the human eye and brain to naturally follow the context of the visualization and understand what it is trying to convey with minimal effort and precision. However, one area of the chart that could be improved is the use of colors. The use of the colors of the bars to denote the different continents is unnecessary and creates too much eye travel that may cause confusion for the audience at first glance. 

For truthfulness, I rate this visualization a 10. In terms of accuracy, I think the length of the bar lines are precise because each bar length increases as it goes up the chart in representing the increase in average daily time spent and there are no vast exaggerations that lead the data to be misrepresented or comparisons that aren't correct. In terms of validity, the title of the graph is “Top Countries by Daily Social Media Use” and the visualization, with the ranking of the countries by average daily time spent on social media from top to bottom, does represent what it claims. 

For intuitiveness, I rate this visualization a 9. I think the visualization is very intuitive for the main audience and also for the general public, especially as the countries are ranked visually from top-to-bottom in order of decreasing average daily time spent on social media so it follows western conventions and expectations that rankings are usually top-to-bottom and we would find the top of the graph to be those of the most numerical values when ranking. This visualization communicates the message clearly in a quick glance by the viewer, without further and longer analysis, which means it is quite intuitive. However, one less intuitive portion of the visualization- the color choices to signify the different continents because there seems to be no intention behind the uses of the colors and seem a bit random so the viewer can easily be confused by what the colors mean if they didn’t have the key at the bottom. A more intuitive way to use colors for the ranking would be using a gradient such as using darker colors for the higher average daily time spent fading to lighter colors. 

For aesthetics, I rate this visualization a 4 because while the visualization is eye-catching due to the number of colors it uses and graphics that pop out from the black background, it is not eye-catching in a effective way. For example, these colors and graphics overwhelm the visualization and are distracting from the message the visualization is trying to convey. The different colors utilized throughout the visualization create too much eye travel and unnecessary complications that do not support or help enhance the overall message of the visualization. For example, with the country flag icons, the chart uses every color of the rainbow so this chart could limit its color use. The yellow border takes too much real estate and goes against expectations because even though it is highlighted in yellow (and with western conventions, yellow is used to highlight), it serves no purpose. Also, with colors, we tend to expect that alike colors signify alike values or ideas, but the use of purple is used in the title, text box, and to denote Africa countries so it provides further confusion and even more eye travel from viewers that may try to decipher the color choices. 

For engagement, I rate this visualization a 6 because it is an interesting topic to see the ranking of the countries by their social media use, especially would be valuable information for its target audience. It is also fairly intuitive and quick to understand the message the visualization is communicating. However, there are other elements, such as the different uses of color and inclusion of unnecessary information, that create a bit of eye travel for the viewer that distracts and detracts from the invitation to examine the information. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution

The primary audience for this visualization is businesses (especially those who have an international presence) and specifically, their marketing teams because marketing utilizes social media platforms and this visualization may be helpful in determining which countries the businesses should target to engage or expand their engagement with through social media depending on which countries have higher daily time spent on social media. I think this visualization is effective for reaching this audience due to its intuitive presentation of the data through the decreasing order of the bars that allows for ease of comparison and the written out average time spent on social media. 

I was debating between utilizing a horizontal bar chart and a map but ended up with a horizontal bar chart because the only reason I wanted to use a map was to highlight which continents the countries were from (like how the original visualization had grouping the coloring of the countries by continents), which may be helpful for businesses and marketers but not only is it likely information that the intended audience already knows, but also, it is unnecessary information for the context and story this visualization is trying to convey since based on the title, the focus is on the top countries, not continents. The main message is focused on the countries and creating a map and adding the information of the continents seems to be too much information for this visualization. Also, because the main message of the visualization is the top countries and their rankings in their daily social media use, I think a horizontal bar chart rather than a map would communicate that information more clearly and quickly because it allows the viewer to see a clear visual comparison between the different countries and their average daily time spent. 

For my redesign using a horizontal bar chart, based upon my critique, I chose to design through a lens of simplicity because most of my insights from the critique method of the visualization were that the aethestics itself were overwhelming and create too much eye travel even though the data itself were presented in an intuitive manner for the most part. 

My overall process was to find ways to remove unncessary elements or elements that do not enhance the main message of the visualization without disrupting the clarity of the message. Therefore, I decided to remove of all of unnecessary elements that created eye travel that I had identified in my critique such as the yellow border, creating consistency but keeping hierarchy of text, removing the colors to denote the continents, removing the black background, removing all of the text boxes and graphics, and removing the flag names. In deciding what elements of the original visualization to remove vs. keep, I was afraid that I may be removing too much information but I tried to reason that even if the information may be somewhat valuable information, if it is not valuable for the context of this specific visualization, due to simplicity, it may be better to remove any elements that do not serve purpose or enhance the message. Also, businesses and marketers are likely busy so when thinking about their time and what visualization may be the most effective clarity-wise and effective in getting only valuable and neccessary information to this audience the quickest, removing information would be more practical for this audience.

It was interesting to realize that as an outsider critiquing a visualiation, it is easier to remove elements. I tend to struggle with creating visualizations with simplicity and clarity because I have a habit of including a lot of information in my charts because I don't want to miss out on particular piece of information and I also tend to use a large array of colors. Therefore, this was a great exercise to be able to consider what elements were necessary vs. unnecessary in someone else's visualization and hopefully, I can apply what I learned here to my future visualizations. I also realized that a visualization can still be effective, and sometimes even more effective, with simplicity and removing elements. 

I changed the title to "Countries by Average Daily Social Media Use" because the original title neglected to add the word "average". As a subtitle, I also added "based on users aged 16-64" because in the original visualization, it was in the bottom right corner in light colored text so it was hard to see and this type of information seems like it would be important to highlight, especially because demographic information is valuable for those working in marketing and businesses. I chose to use one base color for the bars and decided to use a gradient because it follows conventions where the highest values are in a darker color and the lower values are in a lighter color. I chose to use brown for the color of the bars because it typically evokes earthiness and felt appropriate for data that includes countries. I chose helvetica for all of the fonts for legibility and readibility purposes and also to create consistency within the typography compared to the original visualization.  


## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask: 

- What do you think this visualization is trying to portray?

- Is there anything you find confusing or not intuitive?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

- Compared to the original visualization, do you think this is more effective or do you think it takes too much information away and is too simple?

- Do you think a map would be more efficient to represent this information?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
